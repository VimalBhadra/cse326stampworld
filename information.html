      <h1 id="collect">Stamp Collecting</h1>
      <p>Many classic stamps, especially U.S. stamps, have similar designs. The difference may be a tiny printing variation or a grill. If you are a new collector and you see a stamp going for big bucks, you may look at your collection and believe that you have one of these stamps, though chances are you have a stamp of similar design, but much less value.

        The condition of the stamp matters. You might find that the stamps in your collection of significant catalog value are worth much less than you believed. "Buy the best you can afford," isn't just a casually tossed-off phrase, but words to live by in stamp collecting. Inferior quality stamps are, in fact, nearly worthless. You may have purchased some nice stamps at bargain prices, but their resale value can easily be next to nothing–if you can resell them at all.
        
        
        It is the rare collector who can jump into the stamp collecting game and knowledgeably buy the stamps that will hold their value. You can pay a buyer who knows the ropes to put together a stamp collection for you, but where is the fun in that?
        
        If you are a collector and not an investor, and you want to add to your collection, then there is a vast supply of classic stamps available from dealers. Buying from them carries risk, and you may probably wind up with a few stamps that are unwittingly inferior.
        
        In the old days of collecting–that is, when stamp collectors used to actually buy their stamps at stamp shops from stamp dealers–it was easy to get a quick education about stamps. An honest and above-board dealer would never try to sell poor quality stamps to an experienced collector–he wouldn't stay in business long. A reputable dealer would often give advice to new collectors, and that sage wisdom would stress that the condition of the stamp was of major importance.</p>

      <h1 id="album">Stamp Albums</h1>
      <p>The Indian Philatelic history began with the introduction of paper postage in India in 1852. Before that copper tokens were introduced for payment of postage in 1774. Their use was, however, not found to be very convenient and need was felt for some other token of pre-payment. With the success of Penny Postage in England, Sir Bartel Frere, the Commissioner of Sind introduced paper stamps for his province in 1852. These stamps, known as Scinde Dawk, were round in shape and were issued in three variations – embossed on white paper without colour, on white paper in blue and on vermilion wafers. They were withdrawn in October, 1854 on the introduction of the regular India Postage Stamps though their use continued for quite some time.

        In 1854, it was decided to issue stamps for the British India and in the interest of the economy, to have them printed them in India. The first design for the India Postage stamps was attempted by Col. Forbes of Calcutta Mint showing the 'Lion and the Palm tree'. It was a bold and imaginative design but somehow it could never be used. The next stamps to be designed and printed in 1854, by the Surveyor General's Office were blue lithographed half anna stamps showing a youthful profile of Queen Victoria.
        
        While the first India Postage Stamps issued in 1854 bore the inscription 'India Postage', the inscription was changed in the same year to 'East India Postage'. This was changed from 1882 to 'India Postage' and continued till 1962. From November, 1962, a new caption 'भारत' 'INDIA' was introduced replacing the 'India Postage', though three stamps issued in December, 1962/January 1963 carried the earlier inscription.
        
        From the beginning of British Imperialist Rule, when the Queen Victoria stamps were issued in 1854, a portrait of British Monarch had figured in Indian Stamp Designs. This came to an end with India gaining independence on 15th August, 1947. The first independence stamps, issued in 1947, were three in number. They depicted the Ashoka Pillar, (National Emblem of India) the Indian National Flag and an Aircraft. Since then India has issued more than 3000 Stamps.
        
        Growth of Philately
        
        Postage stamp, which begun as a piece of paper in token of receipt of postage, has assumed additional functions. It is a mode of commemorating, celebrating and promoting national heritage and events. It plays a great role as an ambassador, a brand image of postal administration and a statement of sovereignty of a nation. After independence, the medium of postage stamps was initially used to highlight the country's achievements in science and technology as well as its socio-economic Development by depicting themes like the Five Year Plans, Steel Plants, Dams etc. Subsequently, the country's rich cultural and natural heritage came to be showcased and many beautiful stamps were issued in thematic sets on art, architecture, crafts maritime heritage, science, technology, defence and cinematic. Great leaders of national and international standing have also been honoured with commemorative stamps, the most prominent being Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation has been honoured with commemorative and definitive stamps. Personalities, who have made immense contributions in areas like painting, literature, science, music, social upliftment etc., have also been honoured.
        
        In keeping with their dual character as a "Token of Postage" and as "Cultural Ambassador", there are two categories of stamps. The first is meant for day-to-day use as a token of payment of postage on mail articles. These incorporate less complicated design inputs, entailing minimum expenditure in their manufacture, and are printed in large quantities over longer periods. The second, on the other hand, are designed and printed with greater aesthetic inputs. They are manufactured in limited quantities and generate great interest among philatelists and collectors.
        
        What makes Philately a special hobby?
        
        Philately is a delightful hobby that sharpens and satisfies one’s aesthetic tastes. While expanding knowledge of and interaction with the world one gets to know interesting details of politics, history, prominent personalities, national and international events, geography, flora and fauna, agriculture, science, monuments, soldiers, warriors, scientists, arms and ammunition, modes of transport etc. This process of learning becomes more delightful through visuals and brief write-ups. In addition, philately cultivates a meticulous and focused attention to detail. It also helps in making friends across boundaries and age-barriers.
        
        What can be collected?
        
        Both mint - stamps (unused stamps) and used stamps can be collected. These can be collected year-wise, nation-wise or theme-wise. To make this easier and more attractive to beginners, philatelists generally advise collecting stamps according to a selection of choice called a Thematic Collection. Themes may be flowers, birds, animals, architecture, railways, monuments, Red Cross etc. Definitive stamps and stationery can also be collected as a theme. The bottom line is that the collection unfolds various aspects of a theme like a story.
        
        Types of Stamps
        
        There are commemorative and definitive stamps. Commemorative stamps are issued, as the name suggests, commemorating important events, prominent personalities in various fields, aspects of nature, beautiful or rare flora and fauna, environmental issues, agricultural activities, national/international issues, games etc. These stamps are only available at Philatelic Bureaux and counters or under the Philatelic Deposit Account Scheme. They are printed in limited quantities.
        
        Definitive stamps on the other hand, are used for day - to - day postal mailing purposes and are available in various ascending denominations from 25 paisa onwards at all postal counters.
        
        How to collect used stamps?
        
        Used stamps can be collected from the postal envelopes one receives. These can be detached delicately from the postal articles. Rinse in a shallow dish of water, using a soft brush. Carefully dry them in a dark place as the ultra violet rays of sunlight can damage the colours. It is also valuable to retain stamps along with the envelopes on which they are pasted as this authenticates their use.
        
        From where to get stamps?
        
        Mint stamps are available at Philatelic Bureaux and Counters in the designated post offices, details of which are available at nearest Head Post Office. Besides this local philatelists and pen-friends across the country and abroad may be of great help.
        
        How to get and use albums?
        
        Albums are available at leading Book and Stationery stores and with philatelists. Pasting stamps ruins them. Use paper hinges or "havids" to place them in an album. Plastic strip albums are now available and are ideal to use for beginners. Handle stamps with pincers to avoid smudging or damaging them.
        
        What is the Philatelic material available at Philatelic Bureaux ?

        -They provide a standard "First Day of Issue" cancellation on first day cover.

        Contacting Philatelists
        
        Many queries are received from beginners particularly, seeking guidance for starting a collection of postage stamps. You may wish to obtain information or consult the Philatelic Congress of India at https://www.philateliccongressofindia.com/contact.html. The Department of Posts is not, however, responsible for the information etc. supplied by the Philatelic Congress of India as the Department does not handle the secondary market in Philately.
        
        Publications
        
        From time to time, publications of interest to Philatelists are brought out and made available for sale through the Philatelic Bureaux.
        
        Conditions for Reproduction of Stamp Images
        
        Reproduction of stamp images is allowed for illustration purposes in Philatelic Publication or in an article relating wholly on postage stamps which may appear in any magazine, newspaper or publication of a general character. Such reproduction should however, be only in black. If stamps are to be produced in colour for publicity purposes, prior permission of the Director General of Posts must be obtained. To avoid similarity with the postage, such reproduction must be distinctively in smaller or larger sizes than the actual stamp and must be without perforation on the edges. Further, across bar will also be placed on one- corner of the stamp, obliterating the denomination. It must be noted that reproduction of the stamp in colour of the actual size of the stamp with perforation of the edges may be deemed to be taken as production of the actual stamp. Detailed guidelines are available on Guidelines for Use of Images of Postage Stamps.
        
        The philatelic activities of the Department of Posts include:

      <h1 id="collecting">Collecting</h1>
      <p>Stamp collecting is generally accepted as one of the areas that make up the wider subject of philately, which is the study of stamps. A philatelist may, but does not have to, collect stamps. It is not uncommon for the term philatelist to be used to mean a stamp collector. Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps for sheer enjoyment and relaxation without worrying about the tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however, generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas of philatelic studies.

        Postage stamps are often collected for their historical value and geographical aspects and also for the many subjects depicted on them, ranging from ships, horses, and birds to kings, queens and presidents.[2]
        
        Sales of postage stamps are an important source of income for some countries whose stamp issues may exceed their postal needs, but have designs that appeal to many stamp collectors.</p>

      <h1 id="albania">Albania</h1>
      <p>The first stamps were issued in 1913 with overprints on Turkish stamps, a number of interesting and rather temporary stamps were created until December 1913 when Albania’s first full stamp designs were issued. Many beautiful and interesting stamp issues reflect the turbulent history of this beautiful country.

        During WWI Albania was a battleground and was occupied by different powers but the central government continued to issue stamps throughout the period. At the end Italy occupied most of the country but in 1920 the Albanians forced the Italians to recognize Albanian sovereignty. On 7 April 1939 Italy invaded and occupied Albania. Specially overprinted stamps were issued almost immediately and the crown of Albania was offered to the King of Italy. During WW2 Italy used Albania as its base for the invasion of Greece in 1940. The Greeks counterattacked and soon overran almost half of Albania and overprinted stamps for southern Albania on 10 December 1940. When Germany invaded Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941, it returned the control of Albania to Italy. When Italy surrendered in September 1943, Germany immediately assumed the occupation of Albania. Many unusual and interesting stamps were issued during this period.
        
        In January 1945 stamps from the Italian occupation were further overprinted for the new republic and until 1991 Albania was a one-party Communist State, when the first multi-party elections took place.To this day Albania continues to issue interesting stamps which beautifully illustrate its unique culture and history and we would recommend the extensive stamp listing in Stanley Gibbons Part 3 Balkans catalogue, also those published in the Michel Volume 3 Sud-Europa catalogue.

      <h1 id="empire">Austia Empire</h1>
      <p>The Austrian Empire was founded on a remnant of the Holy Roman Empire.  Napoleon I of France had attacked and then crushed the thousand-year-old Holy Roman Empire in 1804.  Following the defeat of Napoleon I, a new empire was founded by the Hapsburg monarch, former Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, who became Emperor Francis I of Austria.  The new empire was composed of his personal lands, within and outside of the boundaries of the former Holy Roman Empire.

        When Francis II assumed the title of the first Emperor of Austria, the empire stretched from lower Poland in the North to the Balkans and Northern Italy in the South, and from Russia in the East to Bavaria and Switzerland in the West.   It would remain the largest and most powerful European empire, until early in the 20th Century.
        </p>
      <p>The multi-national population of the Empire included Germans, Czechs, Poles, Romanians, Hungarians, Italians, Ukrainians, Croats, Slovaks, Serbs, Slovenes and numerous smaller nationalities. The Empire, in this form, lasted from 1804 to 1867.

        The Empire of Austria-Hungary, which lasted from 1867 to 1918, was a monarchical union with the independence-minded Kingdom of Hungary. The union was the result of the Compromise of 1867, under which the Austrian House of Hapsburg agreed to share power with a separate Hungarian government, dividing the territory of the former empire between them.  The Kingdom of Hungary then had their own parliament and internal self-government, but their sovereign continued to be the Austrian emperor.
        
        This union was expressed on official documents as K.U.K. or Kaiserlich und Königlich, meaning Imperial and Royal. This indicated that the Hapsburg monarch, Emperor Franz Josef I at the time, reigned simultaneously as the Emperor of Austria and as the King of Hungary.
        
        The Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved by the Treaty of Versailles, after the end of World War I, and all of its possessions were broken up into independent states, along ethnic and cultural lines.  Unfortunately, this nation-making process made a political and geographical mess out of Eastern Europe, and the fallout would continue through the end of the 20th Century.
        
        The scan at the top of this page is the Austrian Imperial Coat of Arms. The scan at upper right is an early 20th Century postcard, showing the flag of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</p>
